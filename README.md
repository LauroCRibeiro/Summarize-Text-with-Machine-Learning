Text Summarization with Machine Learning

It involves condensing a piece of text into a shorter version, reducing the original text's size while preserving key information and the meaning of the content. Since manual text synthesis is a long and generally laborious task, task automation is gaining popularity and, therefore, a strong motivation for academic research.

In Machine Learning, there are important applications for text summarization in various Natural Language Processing related tasks such as text classification, answering questions, legal text synthesis, news synthesis, and headline generation which can be achieved with Machine Learning. The intention to summarize a text is to create an accurate and fluid summary containing only the main points described in the document.

Types of Approaches to Summarize Text

Before I dive into showing you how we can summarize text using machine learning and python, it is important to understand the types of text summarization to understand how the process works to use logic while using machine learning techniques to summarize the text.

Generally, Text Summarization is classified into two main types: Extraction Approach and Abstraction Approach. Now let’s go through both these approaches before we dive into the coding part.

The Extractive Approach

The Extractive approach takes sentences directly from the document according to a scoring function to form a cohesive summary. This method works by identifying the important sections of the text cropping and assembling parts of the content to produce a condensed version.

The Abstractive Approach

The Abstraction approach aims to produce a summary by interpreting the text using advanced natural language techniques to generate a new, shorter text – parts of which may not appear in the original document, which conveys the most information.

I will use the TextRank algorithm, an extractive and unsupervised machine learning algorithm for text summarization.
